    <h1>HotCut Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Last Update Date: 25th May 2024</h2>
        <p>Welcome to HotCut, a Chrome extension designed to enhance your browsing experience by allowing you to create personalized shortcuts to your frequently visited websites. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you use the HotCut extension.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Storage Data</strong>: The HotCut extension uses Chrome's storage API to store and retrieve data related to your URL mappings. This includes the keywords and the corresponding URLs that you create. All data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers. Please note that HotCut only accesses data created by HotCut itself and does not read any other data.</p>
        <p><strong>Active Tab Information</strong>: The HotCut extension accesses the URL and title of the currently active tab to pre-fill the form with the URL and title of the current page, providing a convenient and user-friendly experience when creating a new shortcut. This data is read in real-time and is not stored or transmitted anywhere outside of your device.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use your information to create and manage your personalized URL shortcuts efficiently and to enhance your experience by providing a pre-filled form with the current page's URL and title.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Since all data related to URL mappings is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Third-Party Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not share, sell, or distribute your data to any third parties. The information accessed and stored by HotCut is solely for your personal use within the extension.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Permissions Justification</h2>
        <p><strong>Storage</strong>: Required to save your URL mappings locally on your device.</p>
        <p><strong>Active Tab</strong>: Required to fetch the URL and title of the currently active tab to provide a pre-filled form for adding new shortcuts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.</p>
